# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio. This space showcases two end-to-end projects that Iâ€™ve worked on to strengthen my skills in data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and dashboarding. Both datasets started in Excel, and one was brought into Tableau to show off a more visual side of the process.

Project 1: Insurance Data Analysis
Overview:
Worked with a dataset of 500 insurance policies using Excel. This project focused on cleaning up the data, organizing it, and creating meaningful visual reports.

Tools & Techniques:
Microsoft Excel
Functions: SUMIF, LOOKUP, MID, LEFT, RIGHT, LEN, FIND, TRIM
Pivot Tables
Line & Bar Charts

Highlights:

Smart Formulas:

Used SUMIF to calculate insured value by state
Filled in business types using policy numbers and lookup formulas

Cleaning Up the Mess:
Pulled out key info from messy text fields using string functions

Visuals That Speak:
Pivot Tables +
Line Chart: Expiry Date vs. Insured Value
Bar Chart: Total Value by Code (sorted high to low)

Project 2: Retail Transactions + Tableau Dashboard
Dataset:
100,000+ rows of retail transaction data from this [Retail Transactions Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/retail-transactions-dataset)

Overview:
Cleaned, prepped, and enriched a large retail dataset in Excel, then brought it into Tableau to uncover patterns and build a dynamic dashboard.

Tools & Techniques:
Excel (prep work)
Tableau (visuals)
Data cleaning, reshaping, aggregation

Highlights:
Added Context:

Included state-level info for demographic analysis
Broke out products from single transactions
Counted products per order for better insight

Interactive Tableau Dashboard:

KPIs: Total Transactions, Total Revenue
